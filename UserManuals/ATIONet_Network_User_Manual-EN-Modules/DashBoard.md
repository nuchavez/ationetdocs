# Dashboard

The Board is a page where you will have a global vision of the operation of your network. The dashboard has specific widgets that will help you make preventive or corrective decisions according to the information and data they show. The data shown in the Dashboard is real time data and some of the widgets are automatically refreshed.
These can be removed or added according to the user's needs in the **My Preferences** option. They can also be placed on the board according to the level of visibility you want to give each one.
The complete list of widgets available for Network subscriptions is as follows:

## Health Status

This widget is very important when starting up the network. This widget gives us information of which parameters we need to configure to be operative. It warns us when, for example, we don't have vehicles or identifications created among other parameters.
This widget can show **Warnings** (yellow icon) when the operation of the network is not in play, but if it shows a red cross indicates that the network is not operational.

## Units/Months

The "Units/Month" indicates the amount of each fuel dispensed in the last month. The last month is the last 30 days from the day of the date. This widget has the ability to filter by Site, City and Fleet. You must select the filter and then enter the value by which it should be filtered. This last field is of the "auto complete" type.

## Today’s Transactions

## List of Outstanding Pre-Authorizations

This list widget displays all pre-authorizations that have not yet received the completion transaction. (For more details on the transaction flow refer to this one [document]( https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md)).

This shows 7 columns:

1. **Authorization Code:** The authorization code assigned to the transaction.
2. **Company:** The company to which the vehicle in question belongs.
3. **SubAccount:** The subaccount that requested the pre-authorization.
4. **Site:** The site where the transaction took place.
5. **Authorized:** The amount that was authorized in the pre-authorization.
6. **Pos:** Position or pump informed by the point of sale or controller.
7. **Age:** The time in minutes that this pre-authorization has been in effect.

The pending pre-authorizations should be dispatches in progress, if there are records in this widget with a high Age, means that the point of sale or controller did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction in the case that fuel has not been dispatched.
